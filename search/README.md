# Front-End Design for Google Search

## Overview

This project aims to create a front-end interface for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search using HTML and CSS. By mimicking the functionality of Google's search pages, we explore how forms work in HTML and how data can be submitted to a web server using query strings.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Main entry point for the project, containing the basic webpage structure and links to CSS stylesheets.

- **styles.css**: Contains styles for formatting and styling HTML elements, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.

## HTML Structure

- **Google Search Form**: Includes an input field for entering search queries and a submit button to trigger the search.

- **Google Image Search Form**: Similar to the Google Search form, but tailored for searching images on Google.

- **Google Advanced Search Form**: Provides input fields for specifying various search parameters for advanced searches.

## Implementation

- **Creating HTML Forms**: Utilizes the `<form>` tag and `<input>` tags to create input fields, with each form specifying a unique action attribute for submitting data.

- **Styling with CSS**: Applies CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the forms, including input fields, buttons, and overall page layout.

## Testing

- Tests the functionality of the forms by entering search queries and submitting them, ensuring correct data submission to Google's search endpoints and proper display of search results.

## Conclusion

This project offers valuable insights into HTML form usage and demonstrates the process of submitting data to web servers using query strings. It also serves as an opportunity to practice HTML and CSS skills while creating a functional front-end interface for Google Search.
