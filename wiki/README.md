# Wikipedia Encyclopedia Entry Project

## Overview

Wikipedia is a widely used free online encyclopedia containing encyclopedia entries on diverse topics. Each entry is accessible via its dedicated page, with the entry's name specified in the route. For example, visiting [Wikipedia - HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) displays the HTML entry.

While HTML is traditionally used for webpage content, it can be cumbersome to write and maintain for every entry. As an alternative, Wikipedia and similar platforms use a lightweight markup language called Wikitext. However, for this project, we'll utilize Markdown for storing encyclopedia entries.

Markdown is a user-friendly markup language that provides an intuitive syntax for formatting text. It offers features for headings, bold text, links, lists, and more, making it suitable for our encyclopedia entries.

## Markdown Syntax

To understand Markdown's syntax, we'll refer to [GitHub's Markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Pay particular attention to syntax for:

- Headings
- Bold text
- Links
- Lists

Markdown provides a simpler and more readable format compared to HTML, facilitating easier editing and collaboration on encyclopedia entries.

## Implementation

Each encyclopedia entry will be stored as a Markdown file, enhancing ease of writing and editing. When a user requests to view an entry, we'll dynamically convert the Markdown content into HTML for display.

By leveraging Markdown, we streamline the process of creating and managing encyclopedia entries while ensuring readability and accessibility for users.

## Conclusion

Using Markdown as the markup language for storing encyclopedia entries offers several advantages, including simplicity, readability, and ease of editing.
